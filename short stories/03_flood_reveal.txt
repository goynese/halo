# What Waits Below

"I've got a bad feeling about this place," Private Jenkins muttered as their squad moved deeper into the ancient structure.

Captain Keyes ignored the comment, focused on the strange symbols etched into the walls. The facility had been sealed for thousands of years, yet the air was stale but breathable. Something about this place felt wrong.

"Spread out and keep your eyes open," Keyes ordered. "Whatever the Covenant are looking for has to be in here somewhere."

The Marines advanced cautiously, weapons at the ready. The facility's architecture was unlike anything they'd seen before on Haloâ€”more organic, somehow. Moisture dripped from the ceiling, and strange growths clung to the walls.

"Sir, I'm picking up some motion," a Marine called out, checking his tracker. "Multiple contacts... but they're small."

"Probably just local wildlife," Keyes suggested, though he didn't sound convinced.

They entered a large chamber with cells lining the walls. Most were empty, their force fields long deactivated. But some still hummed with energy, containing... something.

"What the hell is that?" Jenkins asked, approaching one of the active cells.

Inside was a small, bulbous creature, pulsating with sickly life. It looked like a bloated sac with tentacles, nothing like the Covenant species they'd encountered.

"Don't get too close," Keyes warned.

Too late. The force field flickered and died. The creature launched itself through the opening with surprising speed, attaching to Jenkins' chest before he could react. His scream was cut short as the thing burrowed into his neck, tentacles disappearing beneath his skin.

"Jenkins!" a Marine shouted, rushing forward.

Jenkins convulsed, dropping his weapon. When he looked up, his eyes were vacant, his skin already taking on a mottled, greenish hue. With inhuman strength, he lunged at the nearest Marine.

"Open fire!" Keyes commanded, raising his pistol.

But it was already too late. More cells were failing, releasing dozens of the infection forms. Marines fired in panic as the creatures swarmed them. For every one they killed, two more seemed to appear.

"Fall back!" Keyes shouted over the gunfire and screams. "Get to the entrance!"

Only three of them made it to the corridor before the door sealed behind them. The sounds of combat continued for a few moments longer, then silence.

"What... what were those things?" gasped a wounded Marine.

Keyes shook his head, his face grim. "I don't know. But we need to warn the Chief. Whatever they are, they're not what we came here to find."

As they limped toward the surface, none of them noticed the small, pulsating form that had attached itself to the back of the Captain's uniform, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
