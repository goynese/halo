# Beach Assault

The Pelican dropship roared over the pristine waters surrounding Halo's island facility. Inside, Master Chief checked his weapon one final time as the craft began its descent.

"The Silent Cartographer is somewhere on this island," Cortana explained. "The Covenant believe that what we're looking for is some kind of weapon. They're wrong. The monitor facility should be somewhere inside this structure."

"Echo 419 to ground team," came Foehammer's confident voice over the comm. "I'll drop you at the beach and provide air support as needed. Good hunting, Marines!"

The Pelican's bay door opened, revealing a breathtaking vista of white sand beaches and crystal blue water. It would have been paradise if not for the Covenant forces dug in along the shoreline.

"Go, go, go!" shouted the Marine sergeant as the dropship hovered just above the beach.

Chief was the first one out, hitting the sand in a crouch, assault rifle at the ready. The Marines followed, spreading out in a practiced formation. Ahead, Covenant Elites directed Grunt squads into defensive positions.

"For Earth and all her colonies!" a Marine bellowed as the UNSC forces charged forward.

The beach erupted in chaos. Plasma bolts crisscrossed with human gunfire. Chief moved with superhuman speed, flanking a group of Grunts who were pinning down a Marine fire team. His assault rifle chattered, dropping three of the aliens before they knew he was there.

An Elite in red armor spotted him and charged, plasma rifle spitting hot death. Chief rolled under the barrage, came up with his pistol drawn, and put three precise shots into the Elite's head as its shields collapsed.

"Chief, watch your six!" Cortana warned.

He spun just in time to see a Jackal with its energy shield deployed advancing on his position. Chief waited for the perfect moment, then lobbed a fragmentation grenade behind the shield. The resulting explosion sent the avian alien flying.

Within minutes, the beach was secure. Marines cheered as Echo 419 delivered a Warthog onto the sand.

"I've uploaded the location of the map room to your HUD," Cortana said. "We should move quickly. The Covenant will send reinforcements."

Chief climbed into the Warthog's driver seat, a Marine manning the rear turret.

"Let's find that Cartographer," he said, gunning the engine as they headed toward the facility's entrance.

The hunt for Halo's secrets had only just begun, and somewhere in the island's labyrinthine interior lay answers that would change everything they thought they knew about the ancient ring world.
