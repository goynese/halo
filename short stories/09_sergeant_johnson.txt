# The Sergeant's Speech

Sergeant Avery Johnson took a long drag from his cigar, savoring the harsh taste as he surveyed the ragtag group of Marines gathered before him. They were tired, scared, and a long way from home. The crash landing on this bizarre ring world had scattered UNSC forces across miles of unfamiliar terrain, and the Covenant were hunting them down one group at a time.

But Johnson hadn't survived three decades of war by giving up when things got tough.

"Listen up, Marines!" he barked, his voice carrying across the makeshift camp they'd established in the shadow of a cliff face. "I know you're tired. I know you're scared. Hell, I know some of you are wondering if we're ever going to see Earth again."

He paused, making eye contact with each soldier in turn. Some looked away. Others met his gaze with determination or resignation.

"Well, I'm here to tell you that we are NOT going to die on this oversized hula hoop! You know why? Because we are UNSC Marines, and Marines don't know how to die!"

A few nervous chuckles rippled through the group. Johnson paced before them, the cigar clenched between his teeth.

"The Covenant think they've got us on the run. They think we're easy prey. But let me tell you something about the Covenant." He leaned forward conspiratorially. "They ain't never met Marines like you and me!"

More laughter now, stronger. Johnson could see the spark returning to their eyes. Good. Fear was the enemy as much as any alien zealot.

"Now, I won't lie to you. We're in a tough spot. We're outnumbered, outgunned, and stuck on this weird-ass ring in the middle of nowhere. But we've got three things the Covenant don't have."

He held up one finger. "First, we've got the Master Chief. That man is worth an entire platoon, and he's out there right now, raising hell and making the Covenant wish they'd never heard of humanity."

A second finger joined the first. "Second, we've got each other. Marines stick together. We fight for each other. We die for each other if we have to—but today is NOT that day!"

The third finger rose. "And third, we've got ME! And I did not survive Harvest, Reach, and every godforsaken rock in between just to die here without taking a whole heap of Covenant with me!"

A cheer went up from the assembled Marines. Johnson nodded in satisfaction. They weren't broken yet.

"Alright, people, here's the plan. Recon spotted a Covenant weapons cache two klicks north of here. We're going to hit it fast and hard, grab what we can, and disappear before they know what hit them. Questions?"

A young Private raised his hand. "Sarge, what if we run into those... things? The ones that aren't Covenant?"

Johnson's expression darkened. They'd all heard the reports—strange parasitic creatures that had attacked both human and Covenant forces. The Flood, someone had called them.

"If we encounter hostile non-Covenant forces, we follow standard protocol: shoot until they stop moving, then shoot 'em again to be sure." He took another drag from his cigar. "But our primary objective is weapons retrieval. We hit the cache, we get out. No heroics, no detours."

He checked his watch. "We move out in ten minutes. Check your gear, say your prayers if you've got 'em, and get ready to remind the Covenant why they should have stayed in their own damn galaxy!"

As the Marines dispersed to prepare, Johnson stepped away, gazing up at the artificial sky arching overhead. This ring—this "Halo"—was unlike anything he'd ever seen. Beautiful, in its way. Terrifying in others.

"Penny for your thoughts, Sergeant?" came a voice behind him.

Johnson turned to see Lieutenant McKay, one of the few officers who had survived the crash.

"Just thinking that I've seen a lot of strange things in this war, Lieutenant. But this place..." He gestured at the impossible landscape around them. "This takes the cake."

McKay nodded. "Do you think we'll make it off this ring?"

Johnson grinned, the cigar shifting to the corner of his mouth. "Oh, we'll make it, Lieutenant. I've got a date with retirement and a beach somewhere far from any aliens. And Sergeant Avery Johnson does NOT miss his appointments."

With a final glance at the ring stretching into the distance, Johnson crushed out his cigar and headed back to the Marines. There was work to be done, Covenant to kill, and a way home to find.

And if there was one thing Johnson was good at, it was beating impossible odds.
