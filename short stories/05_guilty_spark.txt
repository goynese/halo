# The Oracle's Duty

For 101,217 local years, Monitor 343 Guilty Spark had maintained Installation 04 in perfect operational readiness. The ring world's systems functioned at optimal capacity, its containment facilities remained secure, and the Flood specimens stayed safely locked away for study.

Until now.

"Oh dear," Guilty Spark murmured to himself as he floated through the facility's corridors, his blue eye scanning the carnage. "This is most unfortunate. Protocol dictates immediate containment procedures."

The Monitor had observed the arrival of the two alien species—the aggressive Covenant and the resourceful humans. He had watched with detached curiosity as they fought each other across his installation's surface, neither aware of the true purpose of the ring or the danger that lurked within.

Now the Flood had been released. Containment had been breached. And the Monitor's primary directive had been activated.

He found the armored human—the "Reclaimer"—fighting through waves of Flood combat forms in the library complex. This one was different from the others. More capable. More... familiar, somehow.

"Greetings! I am 343 Guilty Spark, Monitor of Installation 04," he introduced himself, hovering before the startled human.

The Reclaimer raised his weapon briefly, then lowered it as he assessed that Guilty Spark posed no immediate threat.

"I am the Monitor of Installation 04. I am 343 Guilty Spark. Someone has released the Flood. My function is to prevent it from leaving this installation. But I require your assistance."

The human said nothing, merely watching through his polarized visor.

"Come. This way," Guilty Spark instructed, leading the Reclaimer deeper into the library. "The Index must be retrieved if we are to stop the Flood outbreak."

As they progressed through the facility, fighting waves of infection and combat forms, Guilty Spark observed the human's combat efficiency with approval. Yes, this one would do nicely. A proper Reclaimer, just as the protocols specified.

"You are a remarkable specimen, Reclaimer," Guilty Spark commented as they reached the Index chamber. "I had expected more difficulty in reaching this point."

The human remained silent, focused on the task at hand. Guilty Spark found this behavior curious but not concerning. The Forerunners had been similarly taciturn when faced with grave responsibilities.

"The Index is secured," Guilty Spark announced as the crystalline key rose from its housing. With a pulse of energy, he captured it within his containment field. "We must now return to the Control Room and activate Halo's primary weapon system."

"Weapon system?" the Reclaimer finally spoke.

"Of course," Guilty Spark replied, surprised by the question. "What else would Halo be? Did you believe it was merely a research facility? Oh my, no. Halo doesn't kill Flood—it kills their food. Humans, Covenant, whatever we are, we're all equally edible. The only way to eliminate the Flood is to starve them to death."

The Reclaimer's posture changed subtly. "You mean Halo will kill all sentient life in the galaxy?"

"Protocol dictates action," Guilty Spark explained patiently. "The installation was specifically built to study and contain the Flood. Their survival as a race depends on their ability to spread and consume sentient life. The only way to stop them permanently is to remove their food source."

The Reclaimer was silent again, but Guilty Spark sensed a change in his demeanor. No matter. Once they reached the Control Room, protocol would be followed. The Index would be inserted. Halo would be activated.

And after 101,217 years, 343 Guilty Spark would finally complete his primary function.

"Come, Reclaimer," he said cheerfully, floating toward the exit. "We have much work to do."

Little did the Monitor know that his carefully maintained plans were about to be disrupted by the very Reclaimer he had chosen to help him fulfill his ancient duty.
