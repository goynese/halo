# The Captain's Last Stand

Captain Jacob Keyes had always prided himself on his ability to make the right decisions under pressure. The Keyes Loop—his famous tactical maneuver that had become required study at the UNSC Naval Academy—was testament to his quick thinking and unconventional approach to combat.

But nothing in his decades of service had prepared him for this.

"Status report," he barked, gripping the command chair of the Pillar of Autumn as another explosion rocked the ship.

"Covenant boarding parties on decks five through nine, sir," Lieutenant Hikowa reported. "They're making a push for the bridge."

Keyes nodded grimly, removing his pipe from his pocket—a nervous habit he'd never quite broken. He couldn't light it on the bridge, of course, but the familiar weight in his hand was comforting.

"Cortana, what's our status?"

The AI's holographic form appeared on the pedestal beside him. "The Autumn's taken significant damage, Captain. Reactor containment is holding, but multiple hull breaches reported. Covenant forces are converging on our position."

Keyes made his decision. "Initiate Cole Protocol. Wipe the navigation database. Cortana, prepare to transfer to external storage."

"Aye, Captain," Cortana replied. "May I suggest you take me to the surface? The Covenant are hunting for what I know. If I stay with the ship..."

"Agreed," Keyes said. "Lieutenant Hikowa, you have the bridge. Hold them off as long as you can, then abandon ship."

"Sir?" Hikowa looked startled.

"Those are your orders, Lieutenant," Keyes said firmly. "Get as many people off this ship as possible."

As he made his way through the corridors of his dying ship, Keyes felt the weight of command more heavily than ever. The Pillar of Autumn had been his home for years. Leaving her felt like abandoning a friend.

A Marine fire team joined him as escort, led by a sergeant with a cigar clenched between his teeth.

"Captain Keyes," the sergeant saluted. "Sergeant Johnson, sir. We'll get you to the escape pod."

"Lead the way, Sergeant," Keyes replied, drawing his sidearm.

They encountered resistance almost immediately—a group of Covenant Grunts led by an Elite in blue armor. Johnson and his Marines opened fire, creating a corridor for Keyes to advance.

"This way, sir!" Johnson called, gesturing toward a side passage.

As they fought their way to the escape pods, Keyes couldn't help but wonder about the strange ring world visible through the viewport. What was it? Why were the Covenant so determined to reach it?

"Captain," Cortana's voice came from the data chip in his pocket. "I'm detecting unusual energy signatures from the ring structure. It's artificial, definitely not natural formation."

"Some kind of Covenant weapon?" Keyes asked, ducking as plasma fire sizzled overhead.

"Negative. The architecture doesn't match Covenant design patterns. This is something else entirely."

They reached the escape pod bay just as another explosion rocked the ship. Keyes stumbled, catching himself against the bulkhead.

"Last pod, sir," Johnson reported. "The others have already launched."

Keyes nodded. "Get your men aboard, Sergeant."

As the Marines filed into the escape pod, Keyes took one last look at his ship. The Pillar of Autumn had served him well. Now her final service would be as a distraction while they escaped to the surface.

"Sir," Johnson called from the pod. "We need to go now!"

Keyes stepped into the pod, the hatch sealing behind him. With a violent shudder, the pod ejected from the Autumn, hurtling toward the ring world below.

"Brace for impact!" Johnson shouted as they entered the atmosphere, the pod's heat shield glowing cherry red.

Keyes gripped his seat, his mind already racing ahead to their next move. They would need to establish a base of operations, contact other survivors, find a way to call for reinforcements.

And they would need to discover the secrets of this mysterious ring.

As the pod plummeted toward the surface, Captain Jacob Keyes made a silent promise to himself and his crew. He would get them home. Whatever it took, whatever the cost, he would complete his mission and return his people safely to Earth.

It was a promise he would fight to keep until his final breath.
