# First Encounter

The Pillar of Autumn shuddered as another plasma bolt struck its hull. Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 steadied himself against the bulkhead, the newly integrated MJOLNIR Mark V armor responding to his movements with fluid precision.

"Chief, we need to get to the escape pods," Cortana's voice echoed inside his helmet. "Captain Keyes has ordered all personnel to abandon ship."

"Understood," he replied, his voice calm despite the chaos erupting around him.

As they made their way through the corridors of the dying ship, Chief encountered his first Covenant boarding party. Three Grunts waddled forward, followed by an Elite in blue armor. Without hesitation, Chief grabbed an MA5B assault rifle from a fallen marine.

The familiar weight of the weapon felt reassuring in his hands. He took a deep breath, then stepped out from cover.

The Elite roared a challenge, its mandibles flaring wide as it spotted the armored Spartan. Chief responded with a burst of gunfire, the 7.62mm rounds pinging off the Elite's energy shields. The Grunts scattered, their high-pitched squeals echoing in the confined space.

Chief rolled to the side as a plasma bolt sizzled past his head. The smell of ionized air filled his nostrils as he came up firing, emptying half a magazine into the Elite. Its shields flickered and died, and the next burst of bullets found flesh, purple blood spattering across the deck.

The Grunts, seeing their leader fall, turned to flee. Chief dispatched them with mechanical efficiency.

"Not bad," Cortana commented. "Though your shields took a 40% hit from that plasma bolt."

"I'll be more careful next time," Chief replied, reloading the assault rifle.

As they continued toward the escape pods, Chief couldn't help but wonder what awaited them on the mysterious ring world hanging in space below. Whatever it was, he would face it as he had faced every challenge beforeâ€”with determination, skill, and the quiet confidence that had made him the UNSC's greatest weapon.

Little did he know that his first steps on Halo would begin an adventure that would change the course of human history forever.
