# Just Another Day in Hell

Private First Class Michael Cho had never wanted to be a hero. He'd joined the UNSC Marines for college money and a chance to see the stars. Now, crouched behind a shattered Forerunner column with plasma fire sizzling overhead, he was beginning to regret that decision.

"Mendoza! Suppressing fire, left flank!" Sergeant Stacker bellowed over the comm.

Cho popped up from cover, his MA5B assault rifle chattering as he sprayed bullets toward a group of Grunts advancing on their position. Two of the squat aliens went down, methane tanks rupturing with a satisfying hiss. The others scattered, their high-pitched squeals cutting through the battlefield noise.

"Nice shooting, Cho!" Mendoza called from his position ten meters away.

Cho didn't have time to acknowledge the compliment. A blue-armored Elite had spotted him and was charging his position, plasma rifle spitting deadly bolts of energy. Cho ducked back into cover, feeling the heat as plasma melted the ancient material inches above his head.

This wasn't how he'd imagined combat would be. The training simulations back on Reach hadn't prepared him for the chaos, the noise, the smell of ionized air and alien blood. They hadn't prepared him for the fear that threatened to paralyze him with each new Covenant assault.

"We need backup!" Stacker was shouting into his comm. "Covenant forces overwhelming our position at grid nine-seven-three!"

Cho checked his ammo counter: twenty-eight rounds left. Not enough to take down an Elite with its energy shields. He reached for his last fragmentation grenade, his hand shaking slightly.

"Cho! That Elite's coming around your right!" Mendoza warned.

Taking a deep breath, Cho pulled the pin, counted to two, and tossed the grenade around the corner of his cover. The explosion was followed by an alien roar of pain. Not waiting to see if he'd killed it, Cho broke from cover and sprinted to a new position, bullets from Mendoza's covering fire zipping past him.

He slid into place behind a fallen tree, breathing hard. The Elite was down, its shields overloaded by the grenade, but more Covenant were pouring into the clearing. Their squad was outnumbered at least five to one.

"Fall back to position Bravo!" Stacker ordered. "Tactical retreat, people!"

As Cho prepared to move, a shadow fell across the battlefield. Looking up, he saw a Pelican dropship descending through the clouds, its chin-mounted gun already blazing at the Covenant forces.

But what caught Cho's attention was the figure that leapt from the Pelican's bay while it was still ten meters above the ground. A massive armored soldier—the Spartan they called Master Chief—hit the ground with earth-shaking force, rolled, and came up firing with inhuman precision.

Three Elites went down in as many seconds. Grunts scattered in panic. A Jackal raised its energy shield, only to have the Spartan casually toss a plasma grenade that adhered to the alien's exposed foot. The resulting explosion sent pieces of the unfortunate creature in all directions.

"Holy shit," Mendoza breathed over the comm.

Cho couldn't help but agree with the sentiment. He'd heard stories about the Spartans, of course. Everyone had. But seeing one in action was something else entirely. The armored giant moved with impossible speed and grace, each shot finding its mark, each movement purposeful and deadly.

Within minutes, the clearing was secure. The remaining Covenant forces had either been eliminated or had retreated into the surrounding forest.

"Marines, report," the Spartan's deep voice came over the comm.

"Sergeant Stacker, sir. Four of us left from Fireteam Zulu. We've been holding this position for six hours."

The Spartan nodded, his golden visor revealing nothing of the face beneath. "Good work, Sergeant. I need your team to secure this area while I proceed to the control room."

"Yes, sir!" Stacker replied with renewed energy. "You heard the Chief, Marines! Set up a perimeter!"

As Cho moved to his assigned position, he found himself standing near the Spartan, who was checking his weapon with mechanical efficiency.

"Sir," Cho said, surprised at his own boldness. "If you don't mind me asking... do you think we're going to make it off this ring?"

The Master Chief paused, his helmet turning slightly toward the young Marine. For a moment, Cho thought he wouldn't answer.

"One fight at a time, Marine," the Spartan finally said. "Focus on staying alive now. We'll worry about getting home later."

With that, he turned and jogged toward the structure's entrance, his armored form soon disappearing into the shadows.

Cho watched him go, then turned back to his duty. One fight at a time. He could do that. And somehow, having seen the Spartan in action, the impossible task of surviving this nightmare seemed just a little more possible.

Checking his rifle one more time, Private First Class Michael Cho took up his position, ready for whatever came next. He wasn't a hero, and he wasn't a Spartan. He was just a Marine doing his job.

And sometimes, that was enough.
