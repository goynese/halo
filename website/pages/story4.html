                    <p>Date: September 22, 2552</p>
                    <p>Location: Installation 04, Pillar of Autumn crash site</p>

                <p>"We need to get off this ring, Chief! Now!" Cortana's voice was urgent in his helmet. "I've initiated Pillar of Autumn's self-destruct sequence."</p>
                 <p>Master Chief sprinted through the corridors of the dying ship, the countdown echoing in his ears. Four minutes and thirty seconds until the fusion reactors went critical. Four minutes until Halo, the Flood, and everything else within a massive radius would be reduced to scattered atoms.</p>
                 <p>"There's a Warthog in the hangar bay. It's our only chance," Cortana guided him through the ship's maze-like interior.</p>
                 <p>The hangar doors slid open to reveal a M12 Light Reconnaissance Vehicle—the Warthog—sitting untouched amidst the chaos. Chief leapt into the driver's seat, the suspension groaning under the weight of his MJOLNIR armor.</p>
                 <p>"We don't have much time," Cortana warned as the ship's AI announced "Three minutes remaining" over the intercom.</p>
                 <p>Chief gunned the engine, the Warthog's tires squealing as they found purchase on the metal floor. Ahead lay a makeshift escape route—a series of maintenance corridors and cargo bays leading to a service exit.</p>
                 <p>The first explosion rocked the ship as they cleared the hangar, sending a wave of heat washing over them. Panels fell from the ceiling, and support beams crashed down, narrowly missing the speeding vehicle.</p>
                 <p>"Two minutes, thirty seconds," the ship's computer announced dispassionately.</p>
                 <p>Chief navigated the twisting corridors at breakneck speed, the Warthog's wheels leaving the ground as they crested rises and plunged down ramps. Sparks showered from damaged electrical systems, and fires bloomed in their wake.</p>
                 <p>"Look out!" Cortana warned as a massive support beam crashed down ahead of them.</p>
                 <p>Chief yanked the wheel hard, sending the Warthog into a controlled slide that carried them through the narrowing gap with inches to spare. The vehicle slammed back onto all four wheels, suspension bottoming out with the impact.</p>
                 <p>"One minute remaining."</p>
                 <p>They burst into a massive cargo bay that stretched ahead for hundreds of meters, ending in a yawning opening to space—and the distant shape of a Longsword fighter.</p>
                 <p>"Floor it, Chief!" Cortana urged.</p>
                 <p>The Warthog's engine roared as Chief pushed it to its limits. The bay was disintegrating around them—floor panels buckling and tearing away, exposing the vacuum of space below. The path ahead became a series of floating islands as the ship tore itself apart.</p>
                 <p>"Thirty seconds."</p>
                 <p>Chief's world narrowed to the rapidly shrinking path ahead and the fighter growing larger in his vision. The Warthog hit a ramp at full speed, launching into the air as the floor beneath it gave way completely.</p>
                 <p>For a heart-stopping moment, they were airborne, suspended between the dying Autumn and the promise of escape. Then gravity reasserted itself, and they were falling—falling toward the Longsword's open bay.</p>
                 <p>The Warthog crashed down inside the fighter with a bone-jarring impact. Chief was already moving, abandoning the vehicle and sprinting for the cockpit.</p>
                 <p>"Ten seconds."</p>
                 <p>His hands flew over the controls, muscle memory from his training taking over. The Longsword's engines ignited, pushing them away from the Autumn just as the countdown reached zero.</p>
                 <p>Behind them, the Pillar of Autumn erupted in a blinding flash of light and energy. The shockwave caught the Longsword, sending it tumbling end over end before Chief could regain control.</p>
                 <p>As the light faded, they watched through the viewport as Halo broke apart, massive chunks of the ring world drifting away from each other, glowing with residual energy from the explosion.</p>
                 <p>"Did anyone else make it?" Chief asked quietly.</p>
                 <p>Cortana was silent for a long moment. "Scanning emergency channels... Nothing. Just dust and echoes."</p>
                 <p>Chief gazed out at the stars, allowing himself a rare moment of reflection. So many lost—Johnson, Keyes, Foehammer, countless Marines. All to stop the Flood and prevent the firing of Halo.</p>
                 <p>"We did what we had to do," Cortana said softly, as if reading his thoughts. "For Earth. For all of us."</p>
                 <p>Chief nodded, setting course for the nearest UNSC outpost. The war wasn't over. The Covenant was still out there. And somewhere, perhaps, other Halos waited to be found.</p>
                 <p>But for now, they had survived. And sometimes, that was enough.</p>
